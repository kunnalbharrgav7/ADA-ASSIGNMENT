#  Implement a parallel algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem.


1. Divide the set of cities into P subsets, each subset assigned to a different processor.
2. For each subset i, do the following in parallel:
    a. Compute the shortest tour for subset i using a sequential TSP algorithm.
    b. Send the resulting tour to a central processor.
3. The central processor merges the solutions from each subset to obtain an approximate solution to the TSP problem.
4. Use a local search algorithm to improve the approximate solution obtained in step 3.
5. If the resulting solution is not satisfactory, divide the set of cities into subsets again and repeat steps 2-4 until a satisfactory solution is found.
