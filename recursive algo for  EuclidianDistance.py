# Implement a recursive algorithm for computing the Euclidean distance between two points in 2D space using divide-and-conquer.


function euclideanDistance(point1, point2):
    if point1 == point2:
        return 0
    else if point1.x == point2.x:
        return abs(point1.y - point2.y)
    else if point1.y == point2.y:
        return abs(point1.x - point2.x)
    else:
        mid_x = (point1.x + point2.x) / 2
        mid_y = (point1.y + point2.y) / 2
        left_point = Point(point1.x, mid_y)
        right_point = Point(point2.x, mid_y)
        top_point = Point(mid_x, point1.y)
        bottom_point = Point(mid_x, point2.y)
        left_distance = euclideanDistance(point1, left_point)
        right_distance = euclideanDistance(right_point, point2)
        top_distance = euclideanDistance(point1, top_point)
        bottom_distance = euclideanDistance(bottom_point, point2)
        min_vertical_distance = min(left_distance, right_distance)
        min_horizontal_distance = min(top_distance, bottom_distance)
        min_distance = min(min_vertical_distance, min_horizontal_distance)
        return min_distance

To test this algorithm, you can create some test cases and check if the output is correct. Here's an example:

point1 = Point(0, 0)
point2 = Point(3, 4)
distance = euclideanDistance(point1, point2)
print(distance)
